# 15_nodejs_app_with_xlsx

A Node.js application with using moment.js, moment-timezone.js and xlsx.js.

It was necessary to create an application to display the current status of the pool and the gym based on the data of the schedule of 
their work and holidays from the xlsx-file. 
Data should have been displayed taking into account the time zone of the pool/gym.

I built a Node.js application using several additional libraries. 
1. To import data from the xlsx file, the library xlsx.js was used. 
2. For the further analysis of data and their processing, the libraries moment.js and moment-timezone.js were used.

In addition, markup of the page was adapted for mobile devices.

I've created the project in English, but client translated interface into Hebrew (that's why in server settings I did separate values 
for open&closed statuses for pool and gym, because they differ in Hebrew), so picture may differ from my screenshots. :-)
